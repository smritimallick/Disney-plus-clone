# Disney+ clone

Disney Plus is an on-demand video streaming platform from America that is operated by Walt Disney Company. The app has a large variety of video content with 6000+ TV episodes and 500+ movies. 
The contents of Disney plus come from Pixar, Star Wars, National Geographic, and Marvel. 

The app would work under the subscription-based model. To access any content, the user has to subscribe to an  available plan.

### Description 

I've created a Disney+ UI clone using `html`, `css` and `javascript`. This clone is very similar to the original website.

As though, it only has one web-page, i.e. homepage. It has several small components like navbar, searchbox, slider and carousel with infinity effect.

I've also included some random movie cards with topics such as - 'Recommended For You',  'Popular Shows' and etc.
